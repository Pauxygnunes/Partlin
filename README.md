Partlin - Linear Partitioning v0.3 is a patch for Max/MSP for didactic purposes in the application and experimentation with the concept of linear partitioning. It is a program aimed at composers, researchers in music, mainly texture and form, and those interested in understanding Partitional Analysis and its derived theories. Its applications include:

- Analysis of linear texture.
- Experimentation with creation of melodies or harmonies.
- Understanding of basic concepts of linear partitioning and melodic texture.

Version 0.3 is in the testing phase, and we offer it as an open-source program.

# Basic Instructions
The interface of Partlin v0.3 features four panels: linear structure, partitioning, control (reset and tempo), and visualization. The user selects one linear structure and one partitioning. The program then automatically starts generating a melody and plots its pitches on the visualization panel.

## Linear structure
All seven possible options are provided. Each letter corresponds to a linear pitch set - x (012), y (013), z (024). The combinations are x, y, z, xy, xz, yz, xyz. After selecting the pitch sets, the four fields below the panel are updated with the repertoire of intervals used in each line of the melody.

## Partitioning
Some options are provided for illustration purposes only (not exhaustive). Each partition represents a melodic behavior, and the intervals of the linear structure are used in each layer or line.

## Reset and tempo
Pressing the reset button will restart the process with the defined choices. This feature is provided for situations where the lines reach the limit of registers or for aesthetic purposes.
The tempo slider can adjust the pace of pitch generation.

# Download and Installation
To install Partlin v1.3 on Windows or Mac OS, download the file Partlinv03 and run on Max-MSP.

Max-MSP is offered by Cycling (https://cycling74.com/) free for 30 days. After the evaluation period, Max-MSP can be used as a runtime for patches, including Meloma.
